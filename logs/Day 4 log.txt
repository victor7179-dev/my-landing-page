What I built today:
* Improved landing page with CSS (bigger heading, hover effects, better spacing)
* Created GitHub repository and made first commit
* Deployed live website on Vercel

What I learned:
* How to use Git commands (git init, git add, git commit, git push)
* How to create GitHub Personal Access Token
* How to deploy a website on Vercel
* My website is now live on the internet!

What confused me:
* GitHub authentication (but solved with Personal Access Token)

Live website URL: https://my-landing-page-pink-ten.vercel.app

GitHub repo: https://github.com/victor7179-dev/my-landing-page

Next step tomorrow:
* Add a new section (About or Services)
* Learn more HTML elements
* Maybe add images to the page
